# Camera collection definition file for Little Game Engine (LGE)
#
#    Multiple cameras can be defined in the same file as separate YAML documents
#    All Vector4's are assumed to be Vector3's with w = 1
#    FOV is HALF of the y-field-of-view angle in degrees
#    Euler Angles are in radians, not degrees!
#    Only one camera can be active at a time. The last declared will be active
